PUSSY CAT, PUSSY CAT, WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?


[Music]

     "Pussy cat, pussy cat, where have you been?"
     "I've been to London to see the new Queen."
     "Pussy cat, pussy cat, what did you there?"
     "I caught a little mouse under her chair."

MARY HAD A LITTLE LAMB.


[Music]

     Mary had a little lamb,
       Its fleece was white as snow,
     And ev'rywhere that Mary went
       The lamb was sure to go.
     He followed her to school one day,
       That was against the rule.
     It made the children laugh and play
       To see a lamb at school.

     2. So the Teacher turned him out
          But still he lingered near,
        And waited patiently about
          Till Mary did appear;
        And then he ran to her and laid
          His head upon her arm
        As if he said "I'm not afraid,
          You'll keep me from all harm."

     3. "What makes the lamb love Mary so?"
          The eager children cry,
        "O, Mary loves the lamb you know,"
          The Teacher did reply;
        "And you each gentle animal
          In confidence may bind,
        And make them follow at your call
          If you are always kind."

SING A SONG OF SIXPENCE.


[Music]

        Sing a song of Sixpence
          A pocket full of rye;
        Four and twenty Blackbirds
          Baked in a pie;
        When the pie was open'd
          The birds began to sing,
        Oh, was not that a dainty dish
          To set before the King.

     2. The King was in his counting-house
          Counting out his money,
        The Queen was in the parlour
          Eating bread and honey;
        The Maid was in the garden
          Hanging out the clothes,
        There came a little blackbird
          And pecked off her nose.

LITTLE JACK HORNER.


[Music]

     Little Jack Horner
     Sat in a corner

     And pulled out a plum
     And said "What a good boy am I!"

     Ding dong bell!
     Pussy's in the well!

     What a naughty boy was that
     To drown poor pussycat,
     Who ne'er did any harm,
     But killed all the mice in father's barn.




[Illustration]

THREE BLIND MICE.


[Music]

     Three blind mice, see how they run!
     They all ran after the farmer's wife,
     Who cut off their tails with a carving knife,
     Did you ever hear such a tale in your life,
     As three blind mice!




[Illustration]

THE MULBERRY BUSH.


[Music]

     Here we go round the Mulberry bush,
       The Mulberry bush,

     On a cold and frosty morning.

Verse 2.

     This is the way we wash our hands

                   We sadly fear,
               Our mittens we have lost."
     "What! lost your mittens, you naughty kittens,
                   Then you shall have no pie."
                   Miew, miew, miew, miew.

     2. Three little kittens they found their mittens,
               And they began to cry,

                   See here, see here!
               Our mittens we have found."
     "What! Found your mittens, you little kittens,
                   Then you shall have some pie."
                   Purr, purr, purr, rr-rr.

     3. The three little kittens put on their mittens
               And soon ate up the pie,
                   "Oh, mammy dear!
                   We greatly fear,
               Our mittens we have soiled."
     "What! soiled your mittens, you naughty kittens,"
                   Then they began to sigh,
                   Miew, miew, miew, miew,
                   Miew, miew, miew.

     4. The three little kittens they washed their mittens,
               And hung them up to dry.
                   "Oh, mammy dear!
                   Look here, look here!
               Our mittens we have washed."
     "What! washed your mittens, you darling kittens,
                   But I smell a rat close by.
                   Hush, hush! miew, miew,
                   Miew, miew, miew."

          Her coat is so warm
        And if I don't hurt her,
          She'll do me no harm.

     2. So I'll not pull her tail,
          Or drive her away;
        But Pussy and I
          Together will play.

     3. She will sit by my side
          And I'll give her some food;

     But none for the little boy
     That cries in the lane!"

GIRLS AND BOYS COME OUT TO PLAY.

     Leave your supper and leave your sleep
     And join your play-fellows down the street.

     Come with a whoop and come with a call
     And come with a good-will or not at all
     Up the ladder and down the wall
     A half penny loaf will serve us all.

          And called it macaroni.
            Yankee doodle, doodle do,
            Yankee doodle dandy;
            All the lassies are so smart,
            And sweet as sugar candy.

[Illustration]

TWINKLE, TWINKLE, LITTLE STAR.


[Music]

     1. Twinkle, twinkle, little star
        How I wonder what you are:
        Up above the world so high
        Like a diamond in the sky
        When the blazing sun is gone
        When he nothing shines upon,
        Then you show your little light,
        Twinkle, twinkle, all the night.

     2. Then the traveller in the dark
        Thanks you for your little spark,
        He could not see which way to go
        If you did not twinkle so.
        In the dark blue sky you keep,
        And often through my curtains peep,
        For you never shut your eye
        Till the sun is in the sky.

LITTLE BO-PEEP.


[Music]

        Little Bo-Peep has lost her sheep,
            And can't tell where to find them:
        Leave them alone, and they'll come home
          And bring their tails behind them.

     2. Little Bo-Peep fell fast asleep
            And dreamt she heard them bleating.
        But when she awoke, she found it a joke.
          For they were still a-fleeting.

     3. She took up her crook, intending to look,
            Determined for to find them;
        She found them indeed, but it made her heart bleed
          For they'd left their tails behind them.

     4. She heaved a sigh, and wiped her eye
            And ran over hill and dale, O!
        And tried what she could, as a shepherdess should,
          To tack to each sheep its tail, O!

     "When will you pay me?" say the bells of Old Bailey;
     "When I grow rich," say the bells of Shoreditch;
     "When will that be?" say the bells of Stepney;
     "I do not know," says the great bell of Bow;
     Here comes a candle to light you to bed,
     And here comes a chopper to chop off your head!




[Illustration]

RIDE A COCK-HORSE.


[Music]

     Ride a Cock-horse
     To Banbury Cross,

     And bells on her toes
     So she shall have music
     Wherever she goes.

WHAT ARE LITTLE BOYS MADE OF?


[Music]

     1. What are little boys made of, made of?
        What are little boys made of?
        Frogs and snails and puppy dog's tails,
        And such are little boys made of.

        Chorus.

        Frogs and snails and puppy dog's tails,
        And such are little boys made of.

     2. What are little girls made of, made of?

        And such are little girls made of;
        Sugar and spice and all things nice,

     3. What are our young men made of, made of?
        What are our young men made of?
        Sighs and leers, and crocodile tears,
        And such are our young men made of;
        Sighs and leers, and crocodile tears,
        And such are our young men made of.

     4. What are young women made of, made of?
        What are young women made of?
        Ribbons and laces, and sweet pretty faces,
        And such are young women made of;
        Ribbons and laces, and sweet pretty faces,
        And such are young women made of.

THERE WAS A LITTLE MAN.


[Music]

     1. There was a little man,
        And he wooed a little maid,
     And he said "Little maid! will you wed, wed, wed?
        I have little more to say,
        Then will you? yea, or nay!
     For least said is soonest mended, ded, ded, ded!"

     2. The little maid replied,
        (Some say a little sighed)
     But what shall we have to eat, eat, eat?
        Will the love that you're so rich in,
        Put a fire into the kitchen?
     Or the little God of Love turn the spit, spit, spit.

     3. The little man replied,
        (Some say a little cried,)
     For his little heart was filled with sorrow, row;
        With the little that I have,
        I will be your little slave,
     And the rest my little dear we will borrow, row.

     4. Thus did the little gent,
        Make the little maid relent,
     For her little heart began to beat, beat, beat;
        Through his offers were but small,
        She accepted of them all,
     Now she thanks her little stars for her fate, fate, fate.

LITTLE BOY BLUE.


[Music]

     Little Boy Blue, come blow your horn,
     The sheep's in the meadow, the cow's in the corn.
     Where's the boy that looks after the sheep?
     He's under the haycock fast asleep.
     Will you wake him? No, not I!
     For if I do, he'll be sure to cry.




[Illustration]

POLLY PUT THE KETTLE ON.


[Music]

     Polly put the kettle on,
     Polly put the kettle on,
     Polly put the kettle on,
     We'll all have tea.

     Sukey take it off again,
     Sukey take it off again,
     Sukey take it off again,
     They've all gone away.

HUSH-A-BY BABY.


[Music]

     Hush-a-by Baby on the tree-top,
     When the wind blows
     The cradle will rock;
     When the bough breaks
     The cradle will fall;
     Down comes baby, cradle and all!
